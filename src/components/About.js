            <p className="text-start fs-5 text-dark  ">Welcome to our todo website! We are a team of dedicated individuals who
                have created this platform to help people stay
                organized and manage their tasks efficiently. Our goal is to provide a simple and user-friendly interface
                that allows
                users to prioritize their daily tasks and get things done.</p>
            <br/>
            <p className="text-start text-dark fs-5">We understand how overwhelming it can be to juggle multiple tasks and
                responsibilities, especially in today's fast-paced
                world. That's why we have created this website to help you keep track of your daily to-dos, appointments,
                deadlines, and
                more. Whether you're a student, a professional, a stay-at-home parent, or just someone who wants to stay
                organized, our
                website is perfect for you.</p>
            
            <p className="text-start text-dark fs-5">Our website offers a wide range of features that make it easy to manage
                your tasks. You can create multiple to-do lists,
                set reminders, and prioritize your tasks based on their importance. You can also categorize your tasks based
                on their
                type, such as work, personal, or errands. This makes it easier to focus on specific tasks and stay
                organized.</p>
            
            <p className="text-start text-dark fs-5">One of the unique features of our website is the ability to share your
                to-do lists with others. This is especially
                useful for teams or families who need to collaborate on tasks. You can invite others to join your list,
                assign tasks to
                specific people, and track progress in real-time. This makes it easy to stay on top of your tasks and ensure
                that
                everyone is working towards the same goal.</p>
            <p className="text-start text-dark fs-5">Another great feature of our website is the ability to sync your tasks across
                multiple devices. This means that you can
                access your to-do lists from anywhere, whether you're on your phone, tablet, or computer. You can also set up email
                or
                push notifications to remind you of important tasks or deadlines.
            
                At our todo website, we are committed to providing the best user experience possible. We regularly update our
                website
